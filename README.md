# Python Scripts
This repo contains a collection of small python scripts I created during my first coding class in university. 

- **animals_module.py**, **driver_for_animals.py** – demonstrates class inheritance and object classification 
- **course_project_RPG.py**, **testrpg.py**, **very_early_rpg.py** – OOP character builder RPG simulation
- **basic_recursion.py** – basic recursive function with input validation
- **distance_calculator.py** – uses physics formulas to calculate distance over time
- **python_password.py** – password strength checker using regex
- **port_scanner.py** – basic port scanner using pythons socket module
- **morse_code.py** – converts alphanumeric text to morse code
- **mailing_list.py** – customer record system using inheritance
- **word_frequency_dictionary.py** – reads a text file and counts word frequencies using a dictionary
- **gui_star.py** – draws an interactive star using pythons tkinter gui framework

This concludes some of my foundation in python, and I look forward to building on them with more tools and projects
